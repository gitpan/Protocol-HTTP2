# NAME

Protocol::HTTP2 - HTTP/2 protocol (draft 12) implementation

# SYNOPSIS

    use Protocol::HTTP2;

# DESCRIPTION

Protocol::HTTP2 is HTTP/2 protocol (draft 12) implementation with stateful
decoders/encoders of HTTP/2 frames. You may use this module to implement your
own HTTP/2 client/server/intermediate on top of your favorite event loop over
plain or tls socket (see examples).

Current status - alpha. Structures, module names and methods may change vastly.
I've started this project to understand internals of HTTP/2 and may be it will
never become production or even finished.
